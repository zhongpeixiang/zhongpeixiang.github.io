Hi! I am an algorithm engineer in the reginal Search & Recommendation Group at Lazada. 

I obtained my PhD from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. Miao Chunyan. My undergrad study is at NTU as well ðŸ˜ƒ. My research interests are natural langauge processing (NLP) and recommendation systems (RS).

Interested in these research areas? Check out my [paper reading notes](https://github.com/zhongpeixiang/AI-NLP-Paper-Readings) on my Github.
