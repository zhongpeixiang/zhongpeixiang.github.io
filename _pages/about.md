Hi! I am currently a forth-year PhD student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. Miao Chunyan. My research interests include **conversational AI**, **affective computing**,  and **natural language processing**. 

Specifically, my research objective is to build truly human-like conversational agents by endowing them with human traits, e.g., **emotion**, **empathy**, **personality** and **commonsense**. I also have some research experience in emotion recognition from EEG signals.

Interested in these research areas? Check out my [paper reading notes](https://github.com/zhongpeixiang/AI-NLP-Paper-Readings) on my Github.

Last but not least, check out the demo page for a [live chat](https://zhongpeixiang.github.io/demo/) with Echo, just another chatbot from my PhD research!
