Hi! I am currently a third-year PhD student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. Miao Chunyan. My research interests include **affective computing**, **conversational AI** and **natural language processing**. My research objective is to augment neural conversational models with emotional intelligence. 

Specifically, I work on **text-based emotion detection and generation**, especially in conversational systems. I also have some research experience in emotion recognition from EEG signals.
